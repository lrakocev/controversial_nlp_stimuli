All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing TFGPT2LMHeadModel.

All the weights of TFGPT2LMHeadModel were initialized from the model checkpoint at gpt2.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the ckeckpoint was trained on, you can already use TFGPT2LMHeadModel for predictions without further training.
All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing TFTransfoXLLMHeadModel.

All the weights of TFTransfoXLLMHeadModel were initialized from the model checkpoint at transfo-xl-wt103.
